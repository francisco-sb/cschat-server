  Make your element sortable with sweet animation of high performance.

  Works at least on ios safari, Mac Safari, Chrome, firefox, mobile chrome

  Should not works at ie < 9

  [demo](http://chemzqm.github.io/sweet-sortable/index.html).

## Features

* High performance animation
* Support mobile and desktop
* Handler element and disabled element can be set be css selector
* Not using html5 D&D, you can style dragging element by css
* Children can dynamic added or removed from list
* ~4k when minified and gzip (umd version)

## Limitation

* `border-box` must be used for `box-sizing`, eg:
``` css
*, *::before, *::after {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```
* Only horizon and vertical sort supportted
* transition property should **not** exist on dragging elements style attribute (set via css is fine)
* No connect support right now

## Installation

    $ npm install sweet-sortable

Or use the umd version in [build folder](https://github.com/chemzqm/sweet-sortable/tree/master/build)

## Example

``` html
<ul id='languages'>
  <li>Javascript</li>
  <li>Lua</li>
  <li disabled>Google Go</li>

## API

#### events

  - `update`, emitted with change element when sort changes happen.
  - `starting`, emitted just before dragging start
  - `start`(e), emitted when the drag starts.
  - `end`(e), emitted at the end of D&D

#### Sortable(el, [options])

Initialize Sortable with `el`.

`options.delta` is the center distance number in px to config when the animation take place,
`options.delay` set the delay for dragging start and touch move, default `100` (need this to avoid some wired problem)

increase the value if you want animation happens earlier.  default is 10

#### .bind(selector)
